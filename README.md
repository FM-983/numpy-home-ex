# Project: Numpy Exercises
## Files Included

*   `.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook Numpy exercises and solutions.
*   `.py`: Python  solutions .

## How to Run

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Ensure that you have both Jupyter Notebook and Python installed in your environment.
    *   If the code requires any additional libraries (beyond standard Numpy), make sure to install them using `pip install [library name]`.  (For example: `pip install numpy`)
2.  **Instructions:**
    1.  Open the Jupyter Notebook file (`.ipynb`) 
    2.  Read through the exercises presented in the notebook.
    3.  Execute the cells within the notebook to view the solutions and any accompanying explanations.
    4.  If you wish to run the Python code independently, you can execute the `exe.py` file from your terminal or Python IDE (e.g., `python .py`).

## Code Structure

The `.py` file contains the functions and/or scripts used to solve the Numpy exercises.  The code is structured as follows:

*   **Functions:** [List the main functions and a brief description of their purpose.  E.g., `numpy_exercise_1(array): Solves exercise 1 using Numpy array manipulations.`]
*   **Scripts:** [If applicable, list any top-level scripts and their purpose.]

## Exercises and Solutions

The Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) presents a series of Numpy exercises. Each exercise is solved using the Python code in `exe.py`, and the notebook provides explanations of the solutions, often with intermediate steps or visualizations.
